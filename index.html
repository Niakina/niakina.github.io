	<p>“This has all the right elements to keep readers enthralled: a cunning leader with a plan for every occasion, nigh-impossible odds, an entertainingly combative team of skilled misfits, a twisty plot, and a nerve-wracking cliffhanger.”
	– Publishers Weekly Review,</p>
	<p>“Cracking page-turner with a multi ethnic band of misfits with differing sexual orientations who satisfyingly, believably jell into a family.”
	– Kirkus Review</p>
	<p>“Set in a world that will be familiar to fans of the author, this book can be fully enjoyed without having read any previous title… This is an easy choice for teens who enjoyed The Grisha Trilogy, Diviners, or any of the Shadowhunter books.”
	– VOYA</p>
	<p>“Taking what could have been stock characters of young adult fiction—the loner, the rebel, the outcast, and the con artist, the author has fashioned fully fleshed out, dynamic protagonists who will engage and enchant readers. What a thrill it is to return to the world she created with her popular “Grisha Trilogy” (Holt).”
	– School Library Journal Review</p>
	<p>“There are heist stories with ingenious plotting, and then there are heist stories like this one that raise the ante with luminous writing, fully credible characters, a richly developed world, and internal dangers as threatening as the enemy the team faces.”
	– The Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books</p>
	<p>“For every bloody exchange there are pages of crackling dialogue and sumptuous description. Bardugo dives deep into this world, with full color and sound. If you’re not careful, it’ll steal all your time.”
	– NY Times, Sunday Book Review</p>
	<p>“Wildly imaginative, addictive and fast-paced, this spinoff to Bardugo’s popular Grisha trilogy is sure to leave readers begging, bartering and stealing for more….This is a standout novel of the year!”
